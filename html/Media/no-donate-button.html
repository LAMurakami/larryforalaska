I am Larry Murakami and I am running for the Alaska State House in the Fort Wainwright District of Fairbanks.
This district includes areas by the Badger Road gate including Holmes Road
 and areas by Trainer Gate including Hamilton Acres and extending north of College Road to include Wedgewood.
<p>

I will win this election as someone on your side on issues such as the economy, education and veterans affairs.
<p>
I want to return to a time when a bi-partisan coalition in Juneau was working towards common goals of the people of Alaska.
<p>
Now is not the time to reduce educational funding so Alaska, the owner state, can take a smaller share of oil revenue.
<p>

I have been a resident of Alaska since 1962 and a resident of the Fairbanks area for over 35 years.  I went to grade school at Browns Court School near Clear Alaska and graduated High School at Tri-Valley School in Healy, Alaska.

<p>
I am a veteran of the Vietnam War and am currently an employee of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Ten years ago I worked on Fort Wainwright as an Army Civilian. My current position at the University of Alaska is funded by the Department of Defense so I have worked with the military under multiple roles.
<p>

I hope you will remember Larry Murakami as an advocate for the people of Alaska.
