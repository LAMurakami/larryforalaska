I am Larry Murakami and I am in the Fort Wainwright District (Alaska House District 02) of Fairbanks.
This district includes areas by the Badger Road gate including Holmes Road
 and areas by Trainer Gate including Hamilton Acres and extending north of College Road to include Wedgewood.

<p>I have been a resident of Alaska since 1962 shortly after statehood and a resident of the Fairbanks area since my time in the Navy during the Vietnam War in the 1970s. I went to grade school at Browns Court School near Clear Alaska, graduated High School at Tri-Valley School in Healy, Alaska and received multiple degrees from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

<p>I retired from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Region_Supercomputing_Center">Arctic Region Supercomputing Center</a> (ARSC), not coincidentally, the same day they ceased to exist on August 31, 2015.  ARSC was an institution of the University of Alaska Fairbanks and my position was funded by the Department of Defence.  Earlier this century I worked on Fort Wainwright as an Army Civilian.
<p>

I hope you will remember Larry Murakami as an advocate for the people of Alaska.
